name: Statements
theory: |
  Statement is an instruction for a computer. PHP code is a set of statements separated by `;`.

  Here is an example of code with two statements. When you run this code you will see two sentences on the screen, one after the other.

  ```php
  <?php

  print_r('Mother of Dragons');
  print_r('Dracarys!');
  ```

  Actually, it's possible to put a few statements in one line:

  ```php
  <?php

  print_r('Mother of Dragons'); print_r('Drakarys!');
  ```

  but it's considered a bad practice.

instructions: |
  Put these three names on the screen, one after the other: "Robert", "Stannis", "Renly".
